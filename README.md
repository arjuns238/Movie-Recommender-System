# Movie-Recommender-System

This project implements the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.

ex8_cofi.m is the main function

ex8_movies.mat is the movies dataset 

cofiCostFunc.m computes the cost function with regularization and gradient for the collaborative filtering algorithm 

In the last part of ex8_cofi.m, you can enter your own movie preferences and get personalized recommandations from the system. 

The list of all movies and their number in the dataset can be found listed in the file movie idx.txt.
